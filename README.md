Starting from the fork of UnrealEngine for PowerPC 64 Bit Little Endian of Elvis Dowson we have made a fork adding the PowerPC 64 Bit Big Endian.

Access to forks of UnrealEngine sources are possible only in private repository, so to access it you need to navigate to the Unreal Engine licensing page https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eulacheck and follow the instructions.
After have followed the UnrealEngine page istructions you can get our fork https://github.com/robyinno/UnrealEngine.git

More info how startup working with the fork to improve it are available at https://wiki.powerprogress.org/UnrealEnginePPC64
Your help is welcome.
